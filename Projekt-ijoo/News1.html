            <h1>IBM Thinkpad 700</h1>

            <hr>

           
            <p>The IBM ThinkPad 700 (model 700 PS/2) is the first notebook computer for the ThinkPad brand that was released by IBM on October 5, 1992. Another series was released alongside it, the ThinkPad 300 series. The 300 series was meant to be a cheaper, lower performance model line over the 700.</p>
            <p>Both the 700 and 700C were based on the 25 MHz Intel 486SLC processor with 4 MB of memory, and had a nickel metal hydride battery that was claimed by IBM to last almost 4 hours. The 700 had the option of a 80 or 120 MB hard disk size, and a 9.5in 640 x 480 monochrome screen. The 700C had a standard 120 MB hard disk size, and 4, 8 or 16 MB memory options. It also had a 10.4in 640 x 480 active-matrix color screen. Both the 700 and 700C came with MS-DOS 5.02 and Prodigy, an internet service. Other features both included were a modem, serial, VGA, and parallel ports, port replicator, docking station connector, and built in 3 1/2" 1.44 MB floppy disk drive.</p>
